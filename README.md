Medical Assistant System with Symptom-based Chatbot and Doctor Recommendations
A smart medical assistant system designed to help users understand their health symptoms and connect with nearby healthcare professionals. The system features a chatbot that interprets user-provided symptoms and responds with possible health conditions or challenges.

Key Features:

AI-powered Symptom Checker: Users can describe their symptoms in natural language, and the chatbot suggests potential medical conditions based on the input.

Doctor & Hospital Recommendation System (In Progress): The system is being developed to recommend nearby registered hospitals or doctors and will include functionality to set appointments directly.


This project aims to bridge the gap between early symptom awareness and professional medical attention, offering users timely guidance and future access to healthcare services.
